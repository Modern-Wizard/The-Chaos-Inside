# The-Chaos-Inside

## Lurking in the Dark
Without tripping any security defences of Quick Logistics LLC, the Boogeyman was able to compromise one of the employees and stayed in the dark, waiting for the right moment to continue the attack. Using this initial email access, the threat actors attempted to expand the impact by targeting the CEO, Evan Hutchinson.

The email appeared questionable, but Evan still opened the attachment despite the scepticism. After opening the attached document and seeing that nothing happened, Evan reported the phishing email to the security team.

## Initial Investigation
Upon receiving the phishing email report, the security team investigated the workstation of the CEO. During this activity, the team discovered the email attachment in the downloads folder of the victim.

Lastly, it was presumed by the security team that the incident occurred between August 29 and August 30, 2023.

Given the initial findings, you are tasked to analyse and assess the impact of the compromise.
